## Description

Week four homework requires the creation of a quiz using Web API's which we learned this week, as well as additional JavaScript, CSS & HTML which we had already learned in previous weeks.

This project uses the following;

- html
- JavaScript
- CSS

For this project I had to do a lot of reverse engineering and googling to better understand what we had learned this week, since there was a lot. The Web API's were exciting to learn as they started to add 'magic' to our website.

I have also added a couple of graphics to the quiz, fistly a clock spinning backwards when the time starts to count down, second a picture congratulating the user when they have a score above zero, and finally a picture wishing the user better luck next time when they score zero or less.


## Installation
